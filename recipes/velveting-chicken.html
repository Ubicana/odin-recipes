        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Velveting chicken</b> makes it as moist and tender as what's served at the best Chinese restaurants. This is not my technique â€” I got it online. Don't limit this chicken to just Chinese dishes. The velveted chicken can then be stir-fried with vegetables and sauce or stored for a few hours in the refrigerator before cooking.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Chinese rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>8 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg white, vinegar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until smooth. Add sliced chicken; mix to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for <b>30 minutes</b>.</li>
            <li>Bring water and oil to a boil in a pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Add chicken to boiling water and cook until just white on the outside but not completely cooked through, about <b>1 minute</b>.</li>
            <li>Drain chicken and finish cooking in a hot oiled wok or skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, or store parboiled chicken in the refrigerator in a sealed container until ready to use, up to a few hours.</li>
        </ol>
